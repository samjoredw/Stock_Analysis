        **How to use this database:**
        - Enter two different stocks to compare with one another
        - Enter a financial metric for each stock to compare upon
        - Enter a start date and end date
        - Depending on what you choose, a graph will be generated to visualize the data
        
        If you only see one (or neither) of the two stocks on the graph, you likely need to adjust 
        the date range as those companies weren't public yet.
        
        Also, note that  a stocks volume is comparable only to another stocks volume as it is not a 
        monetary metric like the others.
        
        **Usage:**
        
        The ability to assess stocks with one another is essential to finding correlations and
        ultimately drafting a model for learning and predicting.
