                The graph above represents the **180 days** from {start} to {end} where the correlation between
                {stock_name1} and {stock_name2} is strongest.
                
                The correlation between these two stocks is **{round(corr1, 3)}** on a scale from -1 
                (opposing, negative correlation) and 1 (similar, positive correlation).

                This means that these two stocks have around a **{round(corr1 * 100)}%** relationship with one
                another within your date range above. Which is {describe(corr1)[0]}.
                
                **Make Some Changes**
                Play around with the date ranges above to see if this number changes. To find the most correlated
                180 days between these two stocks, put the start date at 1980 and the end date at 2023.
                
                Switch up the stocks and see if you can find the highest correlation between any two metrics and
                any two dates! (Hint: the scale correlation is 0.977) ü§îü§îüßêüßê
